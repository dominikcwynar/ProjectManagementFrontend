# Project Management UI

## Dependencies

- [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install)

## How to run the UI

After installing dependencies and cloning the repository, run in the main folder `yarn install`. It will install all required packages. Then, with use of `yarn start`, the app will open on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). We will not be able to do much though - we have to connect with the API.

## How to connect with the API

To get the API on your machine, follow the steps specified in [API's readme.md](https://github.com/DevArcana/SE-ProjectManagement-API). Proxy server is already configured, so after running both API and UI on your local machine - you can explore the features of our application in full detail.
